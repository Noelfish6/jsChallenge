    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; 
    console.log(players, team) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'],['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,team) //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'].['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lxu']
    //update an array, it will always reference back

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heee hawww';
    console.log(team4,players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'cool'
    console.log(team5,players);    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name:'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };//just a reference

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:90, age:12});
    console.log(cap2, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
